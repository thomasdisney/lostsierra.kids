                <p>Lost Sierra Kids is a local nonprofit in California seeking funding and material donations to open a learning center facility in Graeagle, CA. Each week, we welcome babies through age five (and siblings close in age) and their caregivers free of charge to our community playgroup filled with led music instruction, hands-on nature-based art instruction, and lots of social interaction. Depending on the season, we set up the Mohawk Resource Center in Blairsden or the Graeagle Soccer Field in Graeagle with various children's equipment. Each week our theme and curriculum is different to allow maximum learning and fun. Some weekly themes have included "Can You Find Them?: All About Mushrooms", "Harvest Day: Veggie Exploration" and "Feathered Friends: All About Birds".</p>

              <summary>How Lost Sierra Kids began</summary>
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Founded in January 2024 by Stephanie McCoy after the First 5 Plumas playgroups were unable to continue. Lost Sierra Kids currently connects with dozens of families from all over Plumas County including Portola, Quincy, Clio, Blairsden, Beckwourth, and beyond. On average we host 20-30 children and 10-15 caregivers every week, and we have already served more than 60 families across Plumas County, welcoming new families each week.</p>

              <summary>Why the learning center matters now</summary>
              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>After nearly two years of listening to our community, we realize there is a desperate need for additional accessible childcare in Plumas County. Families routinely face tiring commutes, long waitlists, and construction delays just to reach care. Opening a learning center in Graeagle will let parents work closer to home and keep their young children rooted in the beauty of the Lost Sierra.</p>
